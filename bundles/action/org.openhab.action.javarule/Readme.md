About JavaRule
==============

JavaRule is an experiment to implement something like a Rule directly in Java. It will register itself on the
eventbus, thus allowing use of the busevents in java.

Ideas:

1. implement clean java class
2. export registry into an Enum in order to be imported into  Java???
3. how to call classic actions? (action(name, params....)??) or import services...
